## This task is very useful for me. And this task cleard my every doubts.  MultiThreadedChatServer.java: this topic is very nice. A multithreaded client-server chat application is a program where:One machine runs as a server, Multiple other machines (or terminals) connect as clients, All clients can send and receive messages in real time, The server handles all connected clients simultaneously using threads. Without threads, the server could handle only one client at a time.Threads allow it to serve many clients simultaneously. Threads allow it to serve many clients simultaneously. This is vey useful of this kind of topics. And I used materials from codtech, the material used very much and i watched videos to clear my doubts amd my errors.
